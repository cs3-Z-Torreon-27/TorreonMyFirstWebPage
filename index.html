						<h1> You Belong With Me </h1>
						<h2> by Taylor Swift </h2>
						<h3> You're on the phone with your girlfriend she's upset </h3>
						<h3> She's going off about something that you said </h3>
						<h3> Cause she doesn't get  your humor like I do </h3>
						<h3> I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night </h3>
						<h3> I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like </h3>
						<h3> And she'll never know your story like I do </h3>
						<h3> But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts </h3>
						<h3> She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers </h3>
						<h3> Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find </h3>
						<h3> and that what your looking for has been here the whole time </h3>
						<h3> If you could see that I'm the one who understands you </h3>
						<h3> Been here all along, so why can't you see? </h3>
						<h3> You belong with me, you belong with me </h3>
